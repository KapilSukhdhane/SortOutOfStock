Magento 2 ‚Äì Sort Out-of-Stock Products to Bottom of Category Page

This Magento 2 module moves out-of-stock products to the bottom of category product listings after filters are applied by the customer. It ensures that in-stock items are always prioritized and more visible to users, improving customer experience and potentially increasing conversions.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

   1. This module uses a plugin on Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\ListProduct::getLoadedProductCollection() to intercept the final product collection rendered on the category page.
   2. It separates in-stock and out-of-stock products and merges them back, placing out-of-stock ones at the end.
   3. The replacement is done using PHP Reflection, as the product collection does not provide a public method to reset items.
   4. The logic respects filters and sorting applied by the customer (e.g., filter by attribute, sort by price/name).
